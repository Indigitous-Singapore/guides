#### By Xael Tan, Co-Founder, Inspireo & Product Manager, Invade

Many of us go into product ideation and design with a vague sense of who we are doing it for. This workshop helps you to organise your target audience discussions into relatable personas and is just 7 minutes long so you can get straight into action.

It is strongly recommended that you catch Bryan's, Lillian's and Ryo's workshops first before watching this one - their workshops provide you with techniques and backgrounding that is vital for you to find this workshop useful.
