#### By Ryo Leong, Narrative Marketer, Content Play

“Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door”… yeah, right. 

We can have the best solution for people’s problems, the best intent but we can still be rejected. Jesus was pleaded to go away after He healed the demon-possessed man at Gadarenes. What’s the issue?

Truth is, we respond primarily to emotional appeal rather than logic appeal. It is therefore paramount that we win the hearts of our audience first before we can convince their minds. In this video, Ryo shares insights on how to connect with others drawing inspiration from Biblical stories
