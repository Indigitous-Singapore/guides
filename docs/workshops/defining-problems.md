#### By Bryan Long, Founder, Testing Ground

In this workshop, Bryan will show you a formula for clearly defining a problem that makes it easy for you to understand what the customer wants and the difficulties they face. 

He will also give you the characteristics of early adopter customer segments and explain why it's important for you to niche down rather than be too general with your customer segment. He also ends off with some tips on how to use prayer at this stage of customer discovery.
