title: Opening up Spiritual Conversations
---

#### By Lillian Seow, Senior Digital Strategist, Cru

All relationships begin with conversations. And the same is true when we want to reach people online with the Gospel. 

We need to start with conversations. This workshop explores how to connect with someone and journey with them on their spiritual journey. It answers questions such as where to find people online to talk to, how to carry on a conversation and build friendships that may eventually lead to spiritual discussions. 

The heart behind this workshop is that we become the good news, not just tell the good news.
