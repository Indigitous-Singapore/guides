<p>A common request when engaging Indigitous is how do organisations even begin digital mission projects. One of the challenges is that projects often start out with a simple intention. However, due to multiple party involvement and a desire to be inclusive, project scopes often grow quickly (aka feature creep), and soon become overwhelming. This is a leading cause of project failures and/or stagnation.</p>

<p>This article is written to provide a guide on how to approach project planning and how to avoid the above problems.</p>

<h1 id="before-building-the-product-proposal">Before Building: The Product Proposal</h1>

<h2 id="goal-setting">Goal Setting</h2>

<p>Our goal before designing/building any product is have a sound foundation before we start.</p>

<p><strong>This can include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The problem we are solving (why)</li>
  <li>Defined users, their needs and intentions (who)</li>
  <li>Basic strategy to roll out the product and finding traction (how and when)</li>
  <li>How is success measured? (KPI)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example Brief:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e_ZEClLvQVSA_I_OCYhHW8t56Lp2agrdfH29wNZWNRw/edit?usp=drivesdk">Indigitous SG - LoremLipsum SG Marketplace Track</a></p>

<p>The intention is not to over-plan, but to have an agreement on base objectives and intended audiences such that it allows the team to focus their efforts and not be caught up on differences in intentions and ideas.</p>

<hr />

<p>The following are steps we can take to define this.</p>

<h2 id="1-clarifying-loremlipsum-sg-marketplace-mkp-objectives">1. Clarifying LoremLipsum SG Marketplace (MKP) Objectives</h2>

<p>There seems to be 3 core objectives and many ways to interpret the objectives. Can we bring clarity to the objectives?</p>

<p><strong>Networking of Marketplace Networks (within Churches and Ministries)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ultimately, what is the vision we want to see fulfilled?</li>
  <li>How do LoremLipsum SG play a part (i.e., what does facilitate mean?)</li>
  <li>How is success defined? How broad or specific is this?</li>
  <li>Is this <strong>solely</strong> about connections being formed between these networks?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Promotion and Showcasing of Resources for Marketplace Mentoring/Discipleship</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ultimately, what is the vision we want to see fulfilled?</li>
  <li>How do LoremLipsum SG play a part (i.e., what does facilitate mean?)</li>
  <li>How is success defined? How broad or specific is this?</li>
  <li>Is this mainly about the awareness (promote/showcase) of resources that are available?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Catalysing Nationwide Marketplace Initiatives</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ultimately, what is the vision we want to see fulfilled?</li>
  <li>How do LoremLipsum SG play a part (i.e., what does facilitate mean?)</li>
  <li>How is success defined? How broad or specific is this?</li>
  <li>Marketplace initiatives of what? Is there a definition of how an initiative is qualified as one?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-designing-a-high-level-strategy">2. Designing a High Level Strategy</h2>

<h3 id="prioritising-for-traction">Prioritising for Traction</h3>

<p>Given that resources are limited - which of the 3 objectives would see the best/easiest traction (lowest hanging fruit), and why? Focusing on traction allows us to design for the customers, and not what we perceive as a good product, which may be muddled with other opportunistic concerns.</p>

<h3 id="framing-the-experience">Framing the Experience</h3>

<p>Once an objective has been selected, the <a href="https://app.creately.com/diagram/BrmsD8uW5CZ/edit">Lean UX Canvas</a> can be used to ask and answer many important questions around each objective. At this stage, “solution ideas” can be simplisitic describers (e.g. A Uber for Something, or a match-making platform).</p>

<p>Tech is really only a tool - focus should be on discovering and solving the problem, business outcomes and the user’s outcomes systematically.</p>

<h3 id="capturing-user-stories-recommended"><strong>Capturing User Stories (Recommended)</strong></h3>

<p>To ensure the strategy is based in reality - we can validate what was written in the Lean UX Canvas by interviewing our potential users.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the user(s) exist?</li>
  <li>Does the problem exist?</li>
  <li>Is the benefits important to the user or are there something else?</li>
  <li>Are our assumptions true? (e.g. Networks want to be networked)</li>
  <li>(As an idea) Do they find the solution useful?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="embarking-on-the-strategy-with-laser-focus">Embarking on the Strategy with Laser Focus</h3>

<p>For each team, there should be no further discussion or development on anything else except that one objective, until that objective is decisively canned or have hit a traction goal e.g. 1000 monthly active users.</p>

<p>This requires a clear objective and success metrics designed to ensure that all efforts are well directed towards a common mission.</p>

<h2 id="3-execution-timelines-and-project-management">3. Execution Timelines and Project Management</h2>

<p>While the approach to this project is agile or semi-agile, once priorities and specificity of goals are clear, we can map them onto a timeline so that everyone is clear the broad timelines we are working within.  This can include not just the product building phases, but also the UX phases of the project.</p>

<p>A tool that is suitable is Jira (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing</a>) and it comes with many nifty features that’s suitable for managing products. It is free for up to 10 users.</p>

<h1 id="tools-to-strength-strategy">Tools to Strength Strategy</h1>

<p>These can be helpful to strengthen the strategy:</p>

<p><img src="https://dummyimage.com/16:9x1080" alt="https://dummyimage.com/16:9x1080" /></p>

<p>We can place a mix of deadlines (or target milestones) and project work windows into a gantt chart-like items that can also hold individual “stories” or issues.</p>

<h3 id="kanban-board-in-jira"><strong>KANBAN Board in Jira</strong></h3>

<p>![https://dummyimage.com/16:9x1080(https://dummyimage.com/16:9x1080)</p>

<p>This view allows the tracking of specific tasks or issues as they are surfaced.</p>

<h3 id="pages--project-wiki-in-jira"><strong>Pages / Project Wiki in Jira</strong></h3>

<p><img src="https://dummyimage.com/16:9x1080" alt="https://dummyimage.com/16:9x1080" /></p>

<p>All project documentation (charts, diagrams, etc) can be stored in a project wiki so info can be easily found.</p>

<h1 id="engaging-indigitous">Engaging Indigitous</h1>

<p>If Indigitious is working with you on the project, we can often assist in the following manner:</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: #HACK - Ideas/Prototypes from the Community</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Broad problem statements so as to allow ideation of solutions</li>
  <li>Subject to approval by core team (for theme selection)</li>
  <li>Must have the intention of taking ideas and teams further after #HACK</li>
  <li>Ownership: IP belongs to participants, challenge owners can discuss with participants</li>
  <li>#HACK is in mid-late October, problem statements must be defined by mid August</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 2: Indigitous’ Original and Ideated With Us</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Based on clear goals on Marketplace Objectives (3 colored boxes)</li>
  <li>Core team will be directly involved in product</li>
  <li>#DISCOVER + some kind of #MINIHACK before prototyping/product-building</li>
  <li>Clear phases (duration, goal, outcomes)</li>
  <li>Open-sourced product (shareable to other cities)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option 3: Indigitous Collab, Based on LoremLipsum SG’s Ecosystem</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Also requires clear goals on Marketplace Objectives (3 colored boxes)</li>
  <li>Advisory role at minimum (product/project strategy / UX / tech)</li>
  <li>Core team involvement depends on phases and scope of each phase</li>
  <li>Needs to divide into clear phases (duration, goal, outcomes) and components</li>
  <li>If we build: open-sourced product (shareable to other cities)</li>
</ul>
